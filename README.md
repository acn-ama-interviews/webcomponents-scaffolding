# custom-elements

This project use custom-elements V1 and works great on Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft Edge.
I added the following Polyfills.

- @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs
- babel-polyfill

The only library that I added is lit-html to handle html templates.

Type the following tasks to run the application:

```sh
$ npm i
```

```sh
$ npm start
```

Keep calm and code!
